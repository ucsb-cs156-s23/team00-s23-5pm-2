                Rapid City lies east of Black Hills National Forest in western South Dakota. 
                It’s known as a gateway to Mt. Rushmore, the massive iconic sculpture of 4 U.S. presidents. 
                “City of Presidents,” a series of life-size statues, spans several blocks downtown. 
                North of Rapid Creek, which bisects town, the Journey Museum & Learning Center offers local history and geology exhibits. 
                Snakes are on view at Reptile Gardens zoo.
